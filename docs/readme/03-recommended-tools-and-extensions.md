## AI-Powered Development Tools


### Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-enhanced code editor that helps with code completion, explanation, and refactoring.

**How we use it:**

- Debugging complex issues
- Create tests under the cases considered by the user

**Guidelines:**

- Verify all AI-generated code with tests
- Don't rely on AI for security-critical implementations
- Use as a supplement to, not replacement for, developer knowledge
- Always review suggestions for adherence to our coding standards
- Establish clear rules for Cursor to follow the same design pattern.
