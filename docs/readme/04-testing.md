# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive testing strategy with both unit and integration tests. The testing architecture uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the primary testing framework along with [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) for HTTP assertions in integration tests.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. We mock external dependencies to ensure that we are only testing the functionality of the specific component. These tests are located in `__tests__/unit` folders within each module.

Key unit test areas:
- Services
- Repositories
- Facades
- API integrations

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work correctly together. These tests are located in `__tests__/integration` folders within each module.

These tests focus on:
- API endpoints
- Database interactions
- Authentication flows
- End-to-end user scenarios

## Running Tests

The project includes several npm scripts for running tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
# Recommendation
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:cov

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Best Practices

When writing tests for this project, follow these guidelines:

1. Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests
2. Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.)
3. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
4. Group related tests using `describe` blocks
5. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
6. Keep tests focused on specific functionality
7. Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic
